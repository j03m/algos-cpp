# big o

* Remember to think about best and worst case scenarios. 

## space complexity 

* N is then number of variables

* A fixed number of variables is constant space o(1)
* When size of something scales with the input its o(n)
* The input is not taken into account. NEW storage only. a find function for example is constant storage (unless you are doing something crazy)
